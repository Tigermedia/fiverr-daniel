# WordPress.com Compatibility Issue - Response Draft

Hi Daniel,

**Good news:** I received the WordPress admin invitation ✅

**Potential issue:** I see this is a **WordPress.com hosted site** (not self-hosted WordPress). This could affect our schema delivery method.

## What we need to check ASAP:

### 1. WordPress.com Plan Type
- **Free/Personal/Premium Plans**: Usually restrict custom HTML/JS code injection
- **Business/eCommerce Plans ($25-45/month)**: Allow custom code and plugins

### 2. Schema Delivery Options
**If Business/eCommerce plan:**
- ✅ Can add JSON-LD schema to footer as planned
- ✅ Full customization access

**If lower plan:**
- ❌ Footer code injection may be blocked
- ✅ Alternative: Schema via custom HTML blocks on pages
- ✅ Alternative: Schema plugin installation (if allowed)
- ❌ May need plan upgrade for full functionality

### 3. Service Areas Page
- ✅ No impact - CompanyCam embed should work on any plan
- ✅ Main automation pipeline (CompanyCam → Make.com → Metricool → GBP) unaffected

## Next Steps:
1. **Accept the WordPress invitation** and check your current plan
2. **Test schema access**: Try adding custom HTML in Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS or similar
3. **Let me know your plan type** so I can adjust Milestone 4 deliverable accordingly

## Impact on Project:
- **Pipeline automation**: ✅ No impact (90% of project value)
- **Schema delivery**: ⚠️ May need alternative approach on lower plans
- **Timeline**: ✅ No delay if we identify limitations early

The core automation (GPS photos → neighborhood matching → keyword rotation → GBP posts) works regardless of WordPress plan. Schema is just the final SEO enhancement.

Let me know what plan you're on and I'll adjust the approach accordingly!

Best,
