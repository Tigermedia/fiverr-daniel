# Conversation Summary - Daniel T (CompanyCam Local SEO)

## Timeline of Communications

### Message 1 - Client Initial Scope (Feb 9)
Daniel sent a detailed, ChatGPT-assisted technical scope of work titled "CompanyCam Local SEO Automation." The scope covered:
- Project goal: automate job-site photos from CompanyCam to website map and GBP
- Full tech stack: CompanyCam Elite, Make.com Pro, Metricool Advanced, WordPress
- CompanyCam webhook and API requirements
- Image optimization with GPS metadata preservation
- WordPress Service Areas page with interactive map and schema markup
- Clear developer deliverables list

**Assessment:** Unusually thorough for a Fiverr inquiry. Client clearly invested significant time researching with ChatGPT. The scope was about 90% complete - only needed a few clarifying questions.

### Our Reply 1 - Discovery Questions
We acknowledged the quality of his scope and asked 6 targeted questions:
1. CompanyCam API key and webhook access confirmation
2. Metricool API access on Advanced plan
3. WordPress admin access and page builder (Elementor vs block editor)
4. Showcase volume per month
5. GBP verification status and Metricool connection
6. Timeline preferences

### Message 2 - Client Answers (Feb 9, 5:26-5:38 PM)
Daniel sent multiple messages answering all questions:

**Tools:** Has NOT purchased any tools yet. Wants to confirm we can connect everything before buying. ChatGPT recommended Metricool over Zapier for more options.

**Metricool:** Confirmed Advanced Plan includes API access. Provided step-by-step instructions for getting the API token (from ChatGPT).

**WordPress:** New site with Elementor. Service Areas page created with slug ready. Can provide admin access.

**GBP:** Verified profile with site URL already linked.

**Volume:** ~20 Showcases/month max, 3-5 high-res photos each. Estimated ~300 Make.com operations/month.

**Timeline:** No urgency.

**Work Structure:** Suggested hourly work initially.

**Additional context:** Explained the "Identity Link" (URL on GBP) is done, now needs the "Data Link" (automated photo flow). Described it as "Proof of Work" for local SEO.
