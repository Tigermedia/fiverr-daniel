# Milestone 1 Requirements - CompanyCam Local SEO Automation

Hi Daniel,

Great! I've reviewed both Google Sheets and they're exactly what we need:

✅ **Neighborhoods Sheet**: 50+ locations with GPS coordinates and GBP IDs  
✅ **Keyword Buckets Sheet**: 8 categories with 10 keywords each (80 total)

To start **Milestone 1: Setup & Account Configuration**, I need the following:

## 1. Platform Purchases & Access

### CompanyCam Elite
- [ ] Purchase CompanyCam Elite plan
- [ ] Share Access Token from Settings → Integrations → Access Tokens
- [ ] Confirm "New Showcase Published" webhook is available

### Make.com Pro  
- [ ] Purchase Make.com Pro plan (10,000 operations/month)
- [ ] Share account email for team access invitation
- [ ] I'll build the automation scenario in your account

### Metricool Advanced
- [ ] Purchase Metricool Advanced plan (for API access)
- [ ] Share API Token from Account Settings → API tab
- [ ] Confirm Google Business Profile is connected in Metricool

## 2. Google Sheets Access
- ✅ **Already shared** with: **info@tigermedia.co.il** (Editor permissions)
- [ ] Verify I can edit/add columns for tracking (Last Used dates, Usage Count)
- [ ] Add Review Queue sheet for automation output logging

## 3. WordPress.com Access & Plan Verification ⚠️
- ✅ **WordPress.com admin invitation received**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify WordPress.com plan type (Business/eCommerce required for schema)
- [ ] Check if custom HTML/code injection is available in footer/header
- [ ] Alternative: Schema delivery via custom HTML blocks or plugin if footer restricted
- [ ] Can revoke access immediately after schema installation

## 4. Notification Email
- [ ] Confirm email address for system alerts (orphan jobs, missing suffixes, errors)

## Timeline
Once I have the above, Milestone 1 takes **5 days** and includes:
- Platform account configuration and testing
- Verify all webhook/API connections work
- Set up Google Sheets tracking columns
- Test Haversine geo-matching with sample coordinates
- Confirm Metricool draft post creation works

## Questions?
1. Any issues purchasing the required tools?
2. Preferred timeline for providing access credentials?
3. Need help connecting GBP to Metricool?

Ready to build your automated local SEO system! 🚀

Best,
Tiger Media
