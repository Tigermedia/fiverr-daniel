# Updated Response - Moving Forward with Your Platform Choice

Hi Daniel,

**You're absolutely right** - your research with WordPress.com support was thorough and well-informed. I respect that you've done the homework and found viable solutions.

## After Reviewing Your Findings

✅ **Schema via Custom HTML blocks**: This will work for our automation  
✅ **RankMath Pro**: Separate subscription gives you advanced SEO tools  
✅ **Performance optimization**: Available plugins and Jetpack handle most needs  
✅ **WordPress.com Premium**: Can definitely support our automation project  

**Your question about WordPress "upselling" is spot-on** - they do want to move customers to higher plans, and their support will minimize limitations to keep you happy.

## Let's Focus on What Matters

Rather than debating hosting platforms, **let's build your $3,000 automation system**. Here are your two realistic options:

### Option 1: Continue with WordPress.com Premium ✅
- **Timeline**: No delay - we start Milestone 1 immediately
- **Results**: Good automation effectiveness (75-80% of optimal)
- **Our approach**: Work within your current platform
- **Schema delivery**: Custom HTML blocks + our JSON-LD code
- **Cost**: No additional platform costs

### Option 2: Self-Migration to Optimized Hosting
- **What**: You handle migration, we provide detailed guidance and support
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (your pace) + project timeline
- **Results**: Maximum automation effectiveness (95-100% optimal)
- **Our role**: Migration instructions, troubleshooting support, platform recommendations
- **Cost**: Just hosting costs ($12-25/month) - no service fees from us

## My Recommendation

**Go with Option 1** - WordPress.com Premium. 

**Why?** Your automation will work well, you'll get good SEO results, and we can focus our energy on building the best possible automation system rather than platform migration.

The core value is in the **CompanyCam → geo-matching → keyword automation → Google Business Profile pipeline**. That's where your $3,000 delivers maximum ROI.

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm your choice** - WordPress.com Premium or self-migration
2. **Purchase required tools** - CompanyCam Elite, Make.com Pro, Metricool Advanced  
3. **Start Milestone 1** - Account setup and configuration

**Let's build your automated local SEO system!**

What do you prefer?

Best,
Tiger Media
