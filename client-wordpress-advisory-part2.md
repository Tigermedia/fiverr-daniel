# WordPress Platform Advisory - Your Options (Part 2)

## Your Options

#### Option 1: Professional Migration (Recommended)
- **What**: We handle the complete migration
- **Timeline**: 3-4 days before starting automation project
- **Cost**: $400 additional (one-time)
- **Result**: Optimal platform + maximum automation results
- **Total timeline**: 24 days instead of 20

#### Option 2: Continue with WordPress.com
- **What**: Build automation within platform limitations
- **Timeline**: Original 20 days
- **Cost**: No additional cost
- **Result**: Reduced SEO potential (50-60% of optimal)
- **Long-term**: Limited growth potential

#### Option 3: You Handle Migration
- **What**: We provide guidance, you handle migration
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks additional
- **Cost**: Only hosting costs ($10-15/month)
- **Result**: Full SEO potential once complete

## This Is Your Decision

I want to be completely transparent: **our automation will work either way**. But as someone investing $3,000 in local SEO automation, you deserve to know that your current platform will significantly limit the results.

**Think of it this way**: You're buying a high-performance engine (our automation) but running it in a car with speed limiters (WordPress.com restrictions).

### What I Need to Know

**Before we proceed with Milestone 1:**
1. Do you want to explore migration options?
2. Or should we build the automation within WordPress.com limitations?

**There's no wrong answer** - but I want you to make an informed decision about the platform that will house your $3,000 SEO investment.

### Next Steps

**If you want to explore migration:**
- I'll send hosting recommendations and migration details
- We can include migration as "Milestone 0.5"
- Project starts with optimal foundation

**If you prefer to continue with WordPress.com:**
- We'll proceed with current timeline
- I'll optimize within platform constraints  
- You'll still get good results, just not maximum potential

**Your choice.** Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Best,
Tiger Media

**P.S.** This recommendation comes from wanting to deliver the best possible results for your investment. The automation itself is solid either way - but the platform makes a huge difference in SEO outcomes.
