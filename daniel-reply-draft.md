# Daniel T - Getting Started Form Reply (Draft)

## Fiverr Message Draft

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for accepting the milestone offer! I've created a comprehensive getting started form to collect all the information I need to begin Milestone 1.

**Complete the form here:** https://docs.tigermedia.co.il/forms/companycam-daniel/

The form covers 5 sections:
✅ Contact details and communication preferences
✅ Account setup (CompanyCam Elite, Make.com Pro, Metricool Advanced)
✅ WordPress admin access 
✅ Google Business Profile verification and connection details
✅ Project preferences and timeline

**Key points:**
- You can complete sections in any order
- Progress is saved automatically - no need to finish in one session
- Each section can be submitted independently
- Mobile and desktop friendly

**Before you start the tools purchases:**
The form will help us verify which tools you need and confirm the setup requirements. As we discussed, please hold off on purchasing CompanyCam Elite, Make.com Pro, and Metricool Advanced until I confirm the exact specifications based on your responses.

**What happens next:**
Once you've completed all 5 sections, I'll review your responses and:
1. Confirm the exact tool requirements and purchase links
2. Verify API access and integration capabilities 
3. Set up WordPress admin access
4. Begin Milestone 1: Setup & Account Configuration

This thorough data collection upfront ensures we can move quickly through the technical setup without any delays or back-and-forth.

Let me know if you have any questions about the form!

Best regards,
[Your name]
