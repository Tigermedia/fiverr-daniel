## [2025-02-10] - Project Kickoff

### Offer Accepted
- Client Daniel T accepted the milestone-based offer on Fiverr
- Total project: $2,000 / 9 days / 4 milestones
- No hard deadline - client has no urgency on timeline

### Discovery Completed
- Received detailed technical scope of work from client
- Client provided answers to all scoping questions
- Confirmed tech stack: CompanyCam Elite + Make.com Pro + Metricool Advanced
- Confirmed volume: ~20 Showcases/month, 3-5 photos each
- Confirmed website: WordPress + Elementor, Service Areas page prepped
- Confirmed GBP: verified and URL linked

### Key Decisions
- Fixed-price milestones chosen over client's initial hourly suggestion
- Client has not yet purchased tools - will purchase after project confirmation
- ChatGPT was used by client to research and write scope - technical claims need verification
